<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Anthony Lopez, I currently live in Palos Heights with my mother who is a paralegal
     at a small law firm, my stepfather who works at a steel mill, and my sister who works for Amazon. I
      am 21 years old, I enjoy reading, playing video games, studying different languages, hanging out
       with friends, and building model kits, more on that later. I am currently majoring in aviation
        administration with minors in aircraft dispatching and Russian language and culture. Though I have
         to admit, my Russian speaking skils aren't the best. In my defense though, it doesn't exactly help
          when almost every word has at least 15 different forms, and I have a very poor memory.</p>
<br>
<p> I am currently a senior, definitely looking forward to graduating soon. However, it's a bittersweet
     feeling that four years have gone by in the blink of an eye. Before Lewis, I didn't have much
      interest in the aviation field. But the first time I got into an aircraft it was like nothing I had
       ever experienced before, and I knew at that moment it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my
        life. So a couple of years pass and I finally arrive at Lewis and begin my flight training, and
         everything was pretty great for the first two years. Life, however had other plans for me. Last year
         , I had a seizure. So I'm grounded for the foreseeable future. However, I figured that I was far too
          close to the end to drop out and quit, so I'm dealing with the hand that life dealt me and making
           the best of it.</p>

<h2> What I Hope to Learn From This Course</h2>
<p> From this course, I hope to have a deeper understanding of computers and how they operate.
<br>
<h3>Items That Interest Me The Most</h3>
<ul>
    <li>How computers interpret and store data</li>
    <li>The various coding languages</li>
    <li>How many lines of code go into making a functional website</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby is building plastic model kits. However, things like model planes, cars, or trains 
    don't particularly interest me. What I build are known as Gundam plastic models. "Gunpla" for short.
     Gunpla is extremely popular, it's been around for the past three decades or so and has attracted the
      attention of model builders of all skill levels from all over the world. So much so that there are
       yearly building championships which give people the chance to show off their modelling prowess to a
        worldwide audience. I don't go that far, building the kits is enough for me.
</p>

<p>Pictured above is the Perfect Grade RX-0 Unit 3 "Phenex." Perfect Grade kits are the pinnacle of
     Gunpla kits, they are the second largest kits you can get featuring the most parts, most intricate
      builds, and special gimmicks. For example, there is an add-on you can get for the kit which lights
       up the internal skeleton a bright blue color. Beautiful for sure, but also extremely expensive.
        Without the lighting kit, the Phenex alone costs over $700. It's for that reason most builders stick
         with high grades and master grades which can range from $20 - $80. I can't get this kit yet, but
          one day I will. Interested in learning more about the history of the hobby? Check out

<h2> Fun Fact About Me </h2>
<p>For someone who wanted so desperately to be a pilot, I used to be terrified of heights. Got over
     that pretty quickly the first time I got on a plane and felt how wonderful it was to fly.</p>
